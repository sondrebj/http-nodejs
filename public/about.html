            <h1>About the workshop</h1>
            <p>The workshop is an important part of the NTNU Gj√∏vik community, providing a space for students to come together and collaborate on projects. 
              It's a place where ideas can come to life and where students can develop the skills they need to succeed in their academic and professional lives.
            </p>
            <p>The workshop is a space where students can come to work on various projects, both academic and personal. 
              It provides access to a wide range of tools, including electric tools such as 3D printers and laser cutters, as well as more traditional tools like saws and hammers. 
              Whether you need to build a prototype for a class project or just want to explore your creativity, the workshop has something to offer.

            <h1>What tools do we offer?</h1>
            <p>At our workshop, we offer a wide range of tools to meet the needs of all users. 
              Whether you're looking for cutting-edge electric tools like our 3D printer and laser cutter, or more traditional tools like a saw, we've got you covered. 
              Our collection of tools is designed to provide students with everything they need to bring their ideas to life, from simple DIY projects to complex builds.
            </p>
          <p>We're proud to offer a comprehensive collection of 50 tools for our students to use. 
            However, it's important to note that some of these tools require users to have a certificate to operate them safely. 
            We prioritize safety at our workshop, so we ask that all students familiarize themselves with our safety protocols and obtain the necessary certificates before using these tools.
